To Do List:


Download .7z files
Decompress them
write files
setup server for text file




Musings:

to make sure that the link_file is up to date on the server we could do something like this

import schedule
import time

def verifylinks():
    lorem ipsum
    this is the function verifying things
    blah blah



schedule.every().monday.do(verifylinks)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)

    ? could this be something that could run on the computer in the atrc consistently?

questions:
    'could you walk me through the code in your nhdplusextractor.py on how it works to download the .7z files and then decompresses them so that I can try and adapt the behavior for the new class?'
